This project explores movie industry data to generate actionable insights for business stakeholders interested in launching a new movie studio. The analysis identifies which types of films perform best at the box office, providing recommendations that can guide investment and content strategy decisions.

We utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, combining data from multiple sources including Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheNumbers, and TheMovieDB.

*This combined bar-and-line chart highlights the top 5 genres that best balance audience approval (ratings) and financial performance (revenue). The blue bars represent average ratings, while the red line shows average worldwide revenue (in millions USD).*

- Sci-Fi leads in revenue (~$339M) but with slightly below-average ratings (~6.45). Its strength lies in blockbuster franchises and mass-market appeal.  
- Animation shows a strong balance, achieving both high revenues (~$312M) and solid ratings (~6.7). This genre is especially attractive due to its family-friendly appeal and global reach.  
- Adventure films also perform well commercially (~$323M) with decent ratings (~6.5), making them a reliable revenue driver.  
- Documentary films receive the highest average ratings (~7.29) but much lower revenue (~$67M), signaling strong critical acclaim but niche market reach.  
- Sports films combine above-average ratings (~6.9) with moderate revenue (~$123M), offering room for future growth with strategic marketing.  

üìå *Insight:* This visualization reinforces our earlier findings:  
Animation, Sci-Fi, and Adventure are the most profitable genres that also maintain respectable ratings, making them ideal for large-scale investment. Documentary and Sport genres, while less lucrative, contribute to brand reputation, critical prestige, and niche audience loyalty. Together, these genres provide a balanced portfolio strategy ‚Äî driving
